## üî® How to run local instance of Poketch?
### üôÖ Without Docker
Poketch looks for those environment variables to be set, so make sure to fulfill all requirements
(database credentials, recaptcha key, SMTP host).  
Make sure those variables are set and available to the app:
```
POKETCH_DB_DIALECT=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect
POKETCH_DB_DRIVER=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver
POKETCH_DB_JDBC_URL=jdbc:mysql://localhost:6033/poketch
POKETCH_DB_PASSWORD=my_secret_password
POKETCH_DB_USERNAME=root

POKETCH_MAIL_HOST=email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
POKETCH_MAIL_PORT=25
POKETCH_MAIL_AUTH_REQUIRED=true
POKETCH_MAIL_PASSWORD=somepass
POKETCH_MAIL_SENDER=noreply@example.com
POKETCH_MAIL_USERNAME=someuser
POKETCH_MAIL_STARTTLS_ENABLED=true
POKETCH_MAIL_STARTTLS_REQUIRED=true

POKETCH_RECAPTCHA_SITEKEY=6Lcql...
POKETCH_RECCAPTCHA_SECRETKEY=BHefc...
```
After setting up the app, check `src/main/resources/init.sql` for some initial Pok√©mon data. 

### üö¢ With Docker 
Check https://gist.github.com/danrog303/267709708969c2de895b329a1a459226 for the example 
`docker-compose.yml` file.
Before running the docker-compose file, make sure to specify reCAPTCHA v2 API key.

The `docker-compose.yml` file will expose:
- `localhost:8080`: the Poketch webapp
- `localhost:8025`: mail server (Webhog)
- `localhost:8081`: database utility (phpMyAdmin)
- `localhost:3307`: database server (MySQL)
